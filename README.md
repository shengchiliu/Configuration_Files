# .vimrc file
This is a code for Vim. Credits go to [fisa-vim-config](http://fisadev.github.io/fisa-vim-config/). I've merely added some simple functions, such as comment/uncomment, excute python, etc. I commented some of the code, and you can uncomment it if you like.

## System

* Ubuntu (or Mac)
* Vim (version 7.4)

## Usage

Download the vimrc file and paste to you home directory as .vimrc.
